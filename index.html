                    <p> Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve<br>
                        my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing<br>
                        some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell<br>
                        phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more<br>
                        sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble)<br>
                        made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that<br>
                        the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>
